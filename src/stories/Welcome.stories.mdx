# Welcome

This is my attempt to set up a development environment for working on cohost posts.

## Dev Workflow
0. clone this repo and install yarn if you haven't already: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook.git
cd cohost-storybook
npm i -g yarn
```
1. install dependencies: 
```
yarn
```
2. start storybook: 
```
yarn storybook
```
3. copy-paste `src/stories/Waterfall.stories.tsx` into a new file inside `src/stories`
4. Use your browser devtools to copy the rendered HTML (I know I know)

See the repo at https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook for more documentation.
