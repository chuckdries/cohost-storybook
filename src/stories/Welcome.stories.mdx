# Welcome

This is my attempt to set up a development environment for working on cohost posts. It's using react because I like react.
See the repo at https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook for TODO and contributing documentation.


## Dev Workflow

0. clone this repo and install yarn if you haven't already:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook.git
cd cohost-storybook
npm i -g yarn
```

1. install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

2. start storybook:

```
yarn storybook
```

3. copy-paste `src/stories/Waterfall.stories.tsx` into a new file inside `src/stories`
4. Use your browser devtools to copy the rendered HTML (I know I know)


> Tip: Toggle the "wrap with posts" control in the bottom panel to enable or disable resizeable posts above and below your post (for testing scrolling effects)

## React/JSX notes

This is React, which means we're authoring in JSX, not HTML. There are some subtle differences:

### All tags must close

All tags must either end in `/>` or have a corresponding closing tag, including html tags that generally don't need one like `<hr>` and `<img>`

```jsx
<img src="..." alt="..." />
// or
<img src="..." alt="..."></img>
```

### Inline styles are applied as an object, not a string

See the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) for more information. I found a helpful website you can paste inline style strings into and spits out an inline style object: https://casbin.org/CssToAndFromReact/

```jsx
<div style="display: block; background: red;" />
// must be converted to
<div style={{
  display: 'block',
  background: 'red'
}}
```
