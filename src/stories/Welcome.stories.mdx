# Welcome

This is my attempt to set up a development environment for working on cohost posts. It's using react because I like react.

## Dev Workflow

0. clone this repo and install yarn if you haven't already:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook.git
cd cohost-storybook
npm i -g yarn
```

1. install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

2. start storybook:

```
yarn storybook
```

3. copy-paste `src/stories/Waterfall.stories.tsx` into a new file inside `src/stories`
4. Use your browser devtools to copy the rendered HTML (I know I know)

See the repo at https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook for more documentation.

## Helpful notes

This is React, which means we're authoring in JSX, not HTML. There are some subtle differences:

### All tags must close

```jsx
<img src="..." alt="..." />
// or
<img src="..." alt="..."></img>
```
### Inline styles are applied as an object, not a string
```jsx
<div style="display: block; background: red;" />
// must be converted to
<div style={{
  display: 'block',
  background: 'red'
}}
```
I found a helpful website you can paste inline style strings into and spits out an inline style object: https://casbin.org/CssToAndFromReact/
