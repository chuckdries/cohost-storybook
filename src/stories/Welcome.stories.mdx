# Welcome

This is my attempt to set up a development environment for working on cohost posts. It's using react because I like react.
See the repo at https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook for TODO and contributing documentation.


## Dev Workflow

0. clone this repo and install yarn if you haven't already:

```sh
npm i -g yarn
git clone https://github.com/chuckdries/cohost-storybook.git
cd cohost-storybook
```

1. install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

2. start storybook:

```
yarn storybook
```

3. copy-paste `src/stories/Waterfall.stories.tsx` into a new file ending in `.stories.tsx` inside `src/stories`
4. Edit the post, including the `title` under `export default`, and then select your post in the storybook sidebar
5. Use the "Show HTML" switch in the "controls" panel to grab the generated HTML for your post!
6. I recommend saving as a draft before you post to double check that things look how you expect. This tool attempts to emulate what a post looks like but it's not perfect


> Tip: Toggle the "wrap with posts" control in the bottom panel to enable or disable resizeable posts above and below your post (for testing scrolling effects)

## React/JSX notes

This is React, which means we're authoring in JSX, not HTML. There are some subtle differences:

### All tags must close

All tags must either end in `/>` or have a corresponding closing tag, including html tags that generally don't need one like `<hr>` and `<img>`

```jsx
<img src="..." alt="..." />
// or
<img src="..." alt="..."></img>
```

### Inline styles are applied as an object, not a string

See the [react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style) for more information. I found a helpful website you can paste inline style strings into and spits out an inline style object: https://casbin.org/CssToAndFromReact/

```jsx
<div style="display: block; background: red;" />
// must be converted to
<div style={{
  display: 'block',
  background: 'red'
}}
```

### className

The `class` attribute is called `className` in react.
